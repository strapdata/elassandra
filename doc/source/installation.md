# Installation
  
## Building from source

* Elassandra uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) for its build system. Simply run the `mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  -Dcassandra.home=<path/to/cassandra>` command in the cloned directory. The distribution will be created under *target/releases*.

## Elassandra Tarball Installation

* Install Java version 8 (check version with `java -version`). Version 8 is recommended, see [Installing Oracle JDK on RHEL-based Systems](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.2/cassandra/install/installJdkRHEL.html).
* Apply OS settings for cassandra, see [Recommended production settings for Linux](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.2/cassandra/install/installRecommendSettings.html)
* For linux, install jemalloc (yum install jemalloc).
* Download Elassandra tarball from [elassandra repository](https://github.com/vroyer/elassandra/releases) and extract files in your installation directory.
* Install the cassandra driver `pip install cassandra-driver` and the cqlsh utility `python pylib/setup.py install`.
* Configure your cassandra cluster (cluster name, snitch, ip address, seed...), see [cassandra configuration](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/initialize/initializeMultipleDS.html). Default Elasticsearch configuration is located in `conf/elasticsearch.yml`, but you should NOT use it, everything is inherited from the cassandra.yml (cluster name, listen address, paths, etc...). 
* Configure cassandra and elasticsearch logging in conf/logback.xml, see [logback framework](http://logback.qos.ch/).
